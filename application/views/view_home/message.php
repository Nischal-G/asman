						<strong>Dear Friends and Well Wishers,</strong><br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been closely associated with ASMAN for 16 years as many of you know whether in the Executive Committee or outside it. My special commitment has been with ASMAN Scholarship Program for which I have worked extremely hard for the past 9 years to get support for it in Nepal and abroad.<br>
						All these years with prompting from a lot of friends - I finally decided to head the next Executive Committee. I have been fortunate in finding and without much convincing 16 eager, excited and capable team members to join in and help take ASMAN further along the path of achievement and more success. However, my team and I need the help, support, encouragement and motivation of all ASMAN members too for every fund raising and new projects that we undertake.<br>
						I would like to thank Ms Soni Joshi and her excellent executive board members who have done a marvelous job of carrying ASMAN's banner for 5 years for which we congratulate. Rekindling our bonds with our Alma Mater, reaching out to marians who are not members yet and keeping in touch with current members will definitely be on our priority list. Here is hoping that during the next 2 years we will be extremely busy involved in fulfilling many worthy goals. Years to come will indeed result in ASMAN to zenith. Wishing for your support and kind generosity, on behalf of my team, I would like to thank each one of you in advance.<br><br>
						Thank you !
